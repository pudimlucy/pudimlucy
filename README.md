You who watch and know and understand none.  
You who listen and hear and will not comprehend. You who wait and wait and drink in all that is not yours by right.  
Come to us in your wholeness. Come to us in your perfection.  
Bring all that is fear and all that is terror and all that is the awful dread that crawls and chokes and blinds and falls
and twists and leaves and hides and weaves and burns and hunts and rips and bleeds and dies!
